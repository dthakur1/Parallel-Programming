Word tearing happens at cache boundaries on Intel (but apparently not
on AMD).

The first form of the assignment in main.cpp results in a cache-aligned
write/read, and you can see that it's atomic.  The second form
carefully constructs a store that happens at cache boundaries, then
does a read from another core to illustrate that it's not atomic.

The computation to be at a cache line boundary is done by rounding up
to the next cache line boundary, then adding 62.
