Use SIMD (AVX specification) to accelerate the computation of the lengths of a sequence of line segments. Each segment is represented by two 4-D points. Thus, for N segments, there would be a total of 2N points. Use Euclidean distance. Use 32-bit floats for the coordinates. Show speedup by implementing both a sequential and a parallel version. You may use your own judgement in deciding how to structure your data for the most speed. A reference for Intel intrinsics is here(https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/).

An example that computes the length of a 3-D vector is at LearningParallelProgramming/SIMD_Instructions/RandomLearning/length.cpp. An example that performs matrix-vector multiplies is LearningParallelProgramming/SIMD_Instructions/RandomLearning/matrix-vector.cpp.
